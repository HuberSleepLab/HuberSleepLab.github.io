Welcome to our comprehensive guide to high-density EEG sleep analysis! 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Quick Start
This series of instructions provides you with everything you need to do to get from raw EEG data to a topoplot showing a statistically significant increase in slow wave activity following sleep deprivation. Data will have to be provided directly by Huber Sleep Lab members (regarding <a href="https://lsm.schlaflab.com" target="_blank">this experiment</a>). Otherwise, you can adapt the pipeline to your own data.

### Important tools you definitely should know first
